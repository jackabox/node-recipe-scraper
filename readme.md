# Disclaimer

This project was written for fun and I take no responsibility for how it is used and if use this code to abuse terms and conditions/copyright of various websites. This was mostly done to test a set up of web scraping for a future project with a simple data source.

This project does not store or save the data, merely just returns the data as a JSON object.
